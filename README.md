issue-parser
============

you are in a drupal project and face a tough deadline. you hunted down a bug and filed an issue. the issue-parser is the android app that keeps you tuned about you're issues even while you have a beer in the pub.
if you like this project and your deadlines are not too tough or you are willing to sleep less, you may want to have the source and roll your own app.

if you just want to give the app try, this is the shop link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dom.drupalit
